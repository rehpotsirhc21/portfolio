<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I am a new software developer with experince in SAFe&reg agile. I have worked on the business side as a Principal Product Owner(PO) for clinical related API's built on WSO2 and JAVA. As a PO I lead the transition over to NCPDP ePA transactions, automated clinical criteria selection and created a process to expose real time clinical approvals to prescribers. My interest in development came from a desire to speak the "same language" as the system analysts and developers on my team. 
        I am excited to open up a new chapter in my career and be challanged with having to build products through code.   </p>
